# CSIS3700

# Project 1: Use of makefile to enable separate compilation. Use of fraction class and point class in main.cpp

# Specifies two methods, first being "Naive" or slowest method of finding a closest pair of points

# Second being use of a recursive function "Fast closest pair" using the "Divide and conquer" method to find the closest pair of points

# Usage: ./Project1 [-n | naiveClosestPair] [-f | fastClosestPair] 
# 					[-b | both]
#                   <command> [<args>]
# Test1.dat for unsorted point list
# Test1.out for comparison to output value
